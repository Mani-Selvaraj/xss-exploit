XSS Exploit

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is one of the most well known web application vulnerabilities. It even has a dedicated chapter in the OWASP Top 10 project and it is a highly chased vulnerability in bug bounty programs.

It works in one step:

Test for XSS: The scanner will try to detect if the parameters are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. The tool injects a piece of JavaScript script, including some special HTML characters (>, <, ", ') and it will try to see if they are returned in the response page without sanitization or input validation.
